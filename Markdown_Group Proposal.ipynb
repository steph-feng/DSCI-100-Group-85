    "This past year, Canada’s inflation rate reached a 30-year high of 5.7% (Evans, 2022). In turn, the increase in cost of living has caused 6.4% increase in credit balances (Senett, 2022). Without a comparable increase in wages, Canadians are at a greater risk of credit card default. Credit default occurs when an individual misses the minimum payment due for six months (Bucci, 2022). Credit default has vast ramifications including weak credit scores and lawsuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring precursors to credit default, individuals become equipped to identify warning signs. The following question arises: will an individual default on their credit payment? \n",
    "\n",
    "The “Default of Credit Card Clients” dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository allows us to answer this question. It provides data on an individual’s age, sex, highest level of education obtained, marital status, amount of given credit, history of past payments, bill statement amounts, previous payment amounts, and most importantly, whether this individual had defaulted.

    "We will conduct our analysis using the K-nearest neighbours algorithm. Specifically, we will perform a binary classification on the “Default of Credit Card Clients” dataset. As the data set tracks the credit history of individuals from April 2005 to September 2005, we will focus on data from the latter half of the six-month period. It is likely that if an individual is unable to meet a payment in April, it would be difficult to make a payment in July as well. This assumption allows us to answer our question without compromising accuracy or R’s data-processing capacity. \n",

    "As the BILL_* columns detail the amount of the bill statement that month, the PAY_* columns show the amount of the previous payment, and the LIMIT_BAL is the amount of given credit set by the company, these variables are significant. The amount of the bill statement in combination with the amount of the previous payment allows us to determine the amount of debt the individual has amassed. Moreover, credit limit data demonstrates the initial trust the company had in the individual of whether they are capable of meeting payments. Hence, we plan to use the columns BILL_JUN, BILL_JUL, BILL_AUG, PAY_JUL, PAY_AUG, PAY_SEPT, and LIMIT_BAL as our predictor variables.\n",
